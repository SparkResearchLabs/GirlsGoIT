### How WEB works:

This chapter showcasts basic concepts of WEB as a Big Picture. The purpose of this chapter is to make an overview for participants of what they will have to do and what they will learn during the summer camp. 

This chapter will cover the following things:
* What is WWW?
* HTTP and the structure of urls
* WEB site vs WEB APP
* Understanding of client-server architecture
* What is a WEB server
* How browsers interact with servers (DNS)
	- Request - Response concepts
	- Technologies behind (HTML, CSS, Javascript and other)

2. Understand what are the main "players" of WEB
3. Understand how browsers work
4. Gain an idea of what are they going to build in terms of technical means
5. Get familiar with the terminology of WEB. 

### Product engineering

Product engineering is a primordial thing to start with. This session will help participants understand what are the key aspects they have to consider when creating a WEB APP. During this session, they will have a case study of WEB APP similar to their own projects' WEB APP, so that by the end of the session, participants will have minimal knowledge on how to design the architecture of a WEB APP from scratch.

The presentation will cover:
* Understanding the concept of WEB APP in more details
	- WEB APP components
	- Interaction of server and client
	- Back-end vs Front-end 
	- Server architecture
	- etc.
* Product life cycle
* Specifications and how to create them
* What are the steps of developing the project
* How to transpose the features into technical specs

The outcome of this session is that participants will:

1. Understand what are the required skills for building WEB projects
2. Have a clear understanding of their projects from the technical point of view. 
3. Define a list of things that they will have to complete during the summer camp

### Product Management

Product Management is an important part of project development, during this chapter, participants will get familiar with techniques and methodologies, and tools that are useful for managing, tracking and working with IT projects. This session is half theory, in which, participants will get known with basic Agile/Scrum concepts, how to deal with specifications, creating User Stories, how to prioritize them and from where to start.

Things covered by the presentation:
* What is Agile and Scrum
* Agile product life-cycle
* User Stories
* Kanban Boards
* Knowledge Management
* Communication in team and separation of tasks.
* Tracking, Reporting, Testing, Repeating tasks.

As the outcome of this chapter is considered:

1. a Kanban Board, that will be used to manage their project, 

2. participants will be able to do all the things from scratch without the help of the trainers.

### Ubuntu Quest 

The following chapter is a hands on practical session for discovering the world of software 
development. 

It will be presented to participants:
* what Ubuntu is 
* how it is used for software development
* why it is so widely used
* Ubuntu interface
* Command Line Interface
* Basic command line commands
* working with Ubuntu package manager

The Quest itself, is a practical assignment for the participants, so that they will get used to CLI and to Ubuntu software development environment. The outcome of it is to have participants understand how to use all the tools and facilities provided by Ubuntu OS. And, most important to obtain the minimal knowledge that is necessary for setting up the environment for their projects.
__{they'll know how to work with virtualenv}__

### Basic Python Statements

The whole summer camp is decided to be run on Flask, which is a WEB framework that is written purely in Python. This is why an extremely important thing for the participants is to obtain the knowledge of programming with Python. 

This chapter will cover basic things like: 
* variables
* data types
	- int
	- float
	- char
	- strings
	- lists
	- tuples
	- sets
	- dicts, etc.
* loops 
* conditionals
* functions
* modules
* PEP-8
* a bit of OOP

The session will be run in few iterations that will include: theory, pair programming (with trainers) 
and independent work.


### Playing with "a" Python

This chapter is supposed to improve participants' knowledge and understanding of Python Programming language, by having an interactive session in which we'll simulate the concepts and principles of Python, using real-life analogies. For example, we can simulate the Python's module importing using different sized boxes, so that you'll have one box "imported" (placed) inside another which means that the content of the small one is already inside the big one.


### Hello Flask

Flask is a Python WEB framework. At this point the participants will start literally writing their projects. This session will make an introduction on how and why and when to use Flask. 

The presentation will cover:
* What Flask is
* When? and How? to use Flask
* Flask project structure
	- static files
	- uploads
	- media files
	- settings,etc.
* The "Hello World" with Flask
* Detailed analysis of the demo project(the "Hello World")
* The request-response concept in terms of "route - browser page access"

This session will combine two methodologies of learning: 

a) Case study as a learning tool

b) Learn by doing

After the presentation will finish, the participants, together with their trainers, will have to "play" with the demo project on their computers (that was already installed on their PCs), in order to understand the link between the routes that they write and the way that browsers access them. 

As an outcome of this chapter we have the following:

1. A clear understanding of what Flask is. Why and when to use it!

2. All the participants will have the skills to create a Flask WEB App from scratch.

3. All the participants will have the minimal required knowledge on how to create a new page for the WEB APP, and how to route it.


### Creating the project

In previous chapter the participants learned how to create a minimal Flask application, this session is dedicated to applying that knowledge specifically to their projects. During the next one and a half hours, the participants will have to create their projects directories and set the development environment. This is a hands on practical assignment, and for that reason, the session will have to be run together with trainers. 

By the end of this chapter, the participants will have:

1. A correctly configured development environment.

2. The skeleton of the project (created directories and virtualenv, and also installed libraries)

3. The needed knowledge of how to run the Flask apps.

4. The created routes for their project (as a draft)

5. The defined in details first sprint for their projects.

### Playing with flashcards

This session of fun, will help the participants consolidate the gathered knowledge from previous session. The purpose of such sessions, for participants, is to repeat the things that were presented by trainers, and for trainers, is to analyze how participants assimilate the material and based on that, to adjust the way that they present the information.

The current flashcards will cover the following topics:
* Flask
* Flask project structure
* Routing the pages

### Intro to Databases

The __Introduction to Databases__ chapter have a huge impact on the future work, because it's one of the main pieces of the WEB apps.
This chapter will initiate the participants in the concepts and principles of what a DB is and how to use them.
The presentation will cover:
* What is a DB?
* What kinds of Databases exist and what are the differences between them
* The concepts of RDBMs and interaction of WEB Apps with them
* Installing and configuring the DB servers
* Connection to DB server
* Basic SQL statements
* Tables Constraints


The following session will be run as a training. The participants will have to repeat the actions and insights from presentation. All the snippets that will appear in presentations will be available online, so that participants will deal with it faster, and at the same time, they will learn how to use online resources so that if they encounter some issues in the future, they'll know how to manage them.

By the end of this session, participants will:
* have a clear understanding of the role of DB in a project
* know how to install and configure the DB server
* have minimal knowledge on how to interact with DB server using CLI(SQL statements)

### Choosing the right tool

As the participants have created an "image" about Databases, it's time to give them the tools to work with. This chapter will cover high-level tools to operate with Databases. 

The presentation will cover:
* What are ORMs
* Difference between ORMs
* How to choose an ORM that fits
* How an ORM works
* Integration of ORM tools into the project
* What are the benefits of an ORM

The outcomes of this chapter are:

1. Participants will get to know with a set of ORMs

2. Participants will obtain skills of how to compare/analyze different tools

3. Participants will have installed and configured SQLAlchemy

4. Participants will understand the benefits of using an ORM

__Note:__ [Here](http://www.pythoncentral.io/sqlalchemy-vs-orms/)'s a link that could be useful.

### Database Frameworks

The following chapter will wrap up the things covered in the previous module, by applying them in practice. This section's flow will be specifically directed to teach participants how to implement specific features that will probably be a part of their project. Also, during this session, it will be discussed in more details the ORM features.

Things contained in presentation:
* How to create a model
	- model fields
	- constraints
	- data types, etc.
* Models relationships
* How to query a DB using SQLAlchemy
* Best practices on using ORMs

By the end of this session, the participants will:

1. understand the principle of working with ORM

2. have the needed skills to create models
 
3. have created a list of already created features that they could replicate in their projects

### Modeling the Database

This module is a mix of theory and case study exercise on Database modeling. It is important to know from start what have to build, this is why during this session, trainers and participants will work upon an hypothetical project that will combine in it the features of all the projects that will be developed during the summer camp. 

It will be presented the logical flow of how the database modeling is done:
* Finding the "players" within a project
* Defining the characteristics and behaviour of "players"
* Creating the conceptual models
* Finding and defining the relationships between models
* Creating the DB architecture

This session will be splitted into 2 main parts:

1. The case study

2. The practical assignment

The assignment will replicate the steps followed in case study, but applied on the projects of each team.


So the outcomes of this chapter are:

1. Each participant will have the knowledge to define and create DB models

2. Each participant will understand what are the the questions to ask when modeling the DB.

3. Each team will come up with a draft of their DB architecture.


### Redesign and Build

As a logical continuation of the previous chapter, comes the following one. It starts with a feedback session of DB architecture That was designed in previous chapter by teams. There will be no presentation in this module. The main objective of it is to help participants create the correct architecture and start building it.

By the end of this session, participants have to:

1. Analyze each other's database architecture.

2. Have a clearly defined database architecture.

3. Create the models that implement the needed functionalities for their projects.


### Framing and Design

The following chapter starts the Front-end part of participants' projects. This session will be run by an experienced designer. 

During this session will be presented:
* Basics of UI and UX
	- What UX is
	- UI concepts and best practices
* How to choose and combine resources (images, colors)
* UI design patterns
	- Forms
	- Menus
	- Pop-ups
	- Tabs
	- Tables
	- Headers & Footers
	- Pagination
* Persuasive UI patterns
	- How to attract attention 
		- Reduction 
		- Tunneling
* How to format data
* How to correctly arrange images

This session is an informative one. The trainers will provide useful tools and tips for participants so that they'll get minimal knowledge on how to handle the UI and create great User Experience. The presentation will cover specific examples related to the participants projects, so that they'll have an idea how to apply this knowledge on their needs.

The outcomes of this chapter are:

1. Participants will get minimal knowledge about principles and concepts of UI & UX

2. Participants will be able to sketch up an UI concept for their projects

3. Participants will get minimal needed knowledge on using open source tools to prepare the resources for their projects, such as images, icons, buttons, etc.

4. Participants will be able to distinguish different types of UI elements

### UI Prototyping 

The following chapter is the hands on continuation of the __Framing and Design__ session. During this session participants will have to develop a prototype of the UI for each page of their project.

The session will be splitted in two parts, so that the first part will be a work in groups assignment in which teams will have to develop the concept of User Interface, detailed enough to be able to simulate the experience of using it. While the second part of the session, will be a case study, that will be done all together. The second part will be a session of feedback from trainers and other participants, so that every participant will gather the "good taste" of UI.

__Note:__ [Here](http://ui-patterns.com/)'s a great link for learning about UI and UX.

The results of the module are the following:

1. Each team will have a prototype of the UI for the project.

2. Each participant will have the skills of creating beautiful and meaningful UI

3. Each participant will be able to critically analyze the UI of a page

4. The participants will become familiar with the online resources that help with UI creation


### Basic HTML

HTML is a markup language for describing WEB documents (pages). In this chapter will be presented what is the role of HTML, how it is used, how it fits the WEB and so on.

The presentation will contain the following:
* What HTML is?
* How it fits the WEB?
* HTML versions
* Basic HTML tags
* HTML page structure
* HTML editors
* HTML elements
* HTML attributes
* HTML lists

This chapter will cover in details basic HTML tags and elements. As usual, the session will be ran in few iterations of `theory` -> `pair programming` -> `individual work`. This is a huge topic this is why, it is ok that participants will not be able to memorize all the details, this is why all the snippets presented in the presentations will be available on cheat-sheets (distributed to each participant at the very beginning of the session).

As outcomes of the session will be considered:

1. The clear understanding of the role of HTML in WEB.

2. The ability to create HTML documents.

### Next level of HTML

The following chapter is a continuation of the HTML chapter. This module will cover more advanced topics of User Interface creation. During this session, the participants will learn how to create the page layout, how to integrate HTML documents with their project, where to create them, how to render HTML, what is CSS and how to integrate it to HTML documents, and also the'll be presented a list of useful JavaScript snippets.

The presentation will cover:
* Flask HTML rendering
* What is CSS
* HTML and CSS integration
* HTML page layouts
* HTML Forms
* Flask requests and HTML Forms interaction
* What JS is
* JS snippets

It is important to note that these topics are advanced ones, but they facilitate the development of the project, this is why the participants will have the needed materials in advance, and the trainers will have to work together with their assigned teams on the projects(a bit more intensive).

The outcomes of the module are:

1. Participants will understand how to use HTML in their projects.

2. How to create the needed layout for the specific project in conformation with the UI prototype.

3. Participants will be able to work with the provided snippets of code, and find useful snippets online.

4. Participants will understand how the static files and Flask routes interact.

5. Participants will have implemented all the needed HTML documents for their project.

### Bootstrap

In order to create a great UI for the projects with minimal efort, it is possible to use Bootstrap, that is an HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, projects on the web. In this session will be presented the pros and cons of it, together with meaningful examples and tips on using it.

The presentation will cover:
* What Bootstrap is
* Bootstrap installation
* Why Bootstrap
* Choosing the templates
* How to integrate it to the project (the configuration)
* Bootstrap gadgets
	- Navbars
	- Grids
	- Custom elements
* What responsive pages are
* How to search for help on Bootstrap

This chapter is mostly theory, the presentation will be ran in an interactive way, so that the participants will have the possibility to visualize the changes on the screen directly. Also, as usual, it will be provided snippets of code.

By the end of this session, participants will:

1. have Bootstrap installed and configured.

2. be able to work with provided snippets of code

3. understand how the Bootstrap and Flask interact

4. understand the concepts and philosophy of Bootstrap

### Bootstrap Integration

After installing and configuring the Bootstrap framework, the participants will have to modify early created static files of their projects to use Bootstrap. All the teams will have to adjust the HTML code, together with their trainers, and test the functionalities to work as supposed. 

The outcomes of the session are:

1. Participants will have all the HTML documents adjusted to use Bootstrap

2. Participants will have the minimal skills on integrating Bootstrap to Flask applications.


### Creating a better development experience

3. Participants will know where to find references to the documentation and how to search for it


### Working on the project

This session will summarize all the previously gathered knowledge. Participants will have to work on their projects, in order to finalise the product backlog items. During this session, the participants will have to discuss their issues with their trainers, and, of course, solve them.

It will be perfect if by the end of this session:

1. All the teams will have at least 60% of their projects done.

2. Each participant will have the skills to develop the project he/she works on from scratch.
